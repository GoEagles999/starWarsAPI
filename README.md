Made for a developer test with create-react-app, request npm module and Bootstrap. Single-page application to retrieve data from swapi.co.

Pagination is at bottom left to the table displayed.

To start the app:
'npm start' in the root directory

Improvements:
- Sorting values in columns (ascending/descending)
- Write unit tests
- Wrap application in Express server
- Add loading icon while fetching data
- Add href to fields where there are multiple URLs, break by line
- Format date, and numbers to include separator 
- Create a component for each type's search & result in order to make the application more modular
- Log events to console
